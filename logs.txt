ðŸš¨ Major Issues:

Target Prices Below Current Market: Both TP1 ($112,539.90) and TP2 ($112,137.40) are below the current price of $113,825.86. This is impossible for a long position - you cannot profit by targeting prices lower than your entry point.
Backwards Risk/Reward: You're risking 3.99% (to stop loss) to potentially lose 1.13-1.48% (to targets). This makes no financial sense.
Outdated Resistance Level: The proposed resistance at $116,402 is 5.86% below the recent peak of $123,218, suggesting these levels are based on older price action.

ðŸ“Š What the Data Shows:

Current Price: $113,825.86 (Aug 3, 2025)
Recent Peak: $123,218 (July 14, 2025)
Recent Low: $111,920 (Aug 3, 2025)
Price has declined ~8% from recent highs

âœ… What Would Be More Reasonable:

Support: Around $111,920 (recent actual low) or lower
Resistance: $116,000-$118,000 (previous consolidation area)
Targets: Should be above current price, not below
Stop Loss: Below key support around $111,500

Bottom Line:
These levels appear to be either outdated (calculated when price was lower) or designed for a short position rather than a long position. I'd strongly recommend recalculating based on current market structure before risking any capital.
