1. Price Clusters & Historical Touchpoints
Identify zones (not just lines) where price repeatedly stalls, reverses, or consolidates.

These are areas with multiple wicks/bodies touching or bouncing off.

Instead of a single line, draw a block/range capturing the cluster of candles.

2. Volume Profile
Use volume at price (VAP) or volume profile indicators.

High volume areas often coincide with strong support/resistance zones.

Draw blocks where volume peaks correspond to price rejections or consolidations.

3. Order Book & Market Structure
Look at visible liquidity pools and order book data.

Areas with high buy orders create support blocks; high sell orders create resistance blocks.

Combine this with price action to mark blocks.

4. Fibonacci Zones
Use Fibonacci retracement levels (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) from major swings.

Around these levels, draw blocks as potential support/resistance areas.

Confirm with price action and volume.

5. Swing Highs & Lows with Buffer
Mark significant swing highs and lows.

Instead of a line exactly on the price, add a buffer above and below (e.g., 0.5-1% range) to form a block.

This accounts for noise and makes it actionable.

6. Moving Averages & Confluences
Popular moving averages (50, 100, 200) act as dynamic support/resistance.

When MA levels cluster or align with historical zones, form blocks there.

Bonus: The Psychology Behind Blocks
Support/resistance blocks represent zones where buyers and sellers have historically battled.

These zones attract future attention because market participants place orders there.

Bottom Line:
Method = mix of price action clusters + volume + order book + key Fibonacci and swing levels. Then draw a zone/block with a reasonable margin, not a razor-thin line.
