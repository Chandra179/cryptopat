Probabilistic Risk Assessment Module

Monte Carlo-based probabilistic risk assessment for trading signals.

Implements academic Monte Carlo methodologies following:
- Glasserman (2003): Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering
- Jorion (2006): Value at Risk methodologies 
- ACM Computing Surveys (2014): Monte Carlo VaR applications

Provides probability distributions for bull/bear/base case scenarios
using signal strength as input parameters for Monte Carlo simulation.
